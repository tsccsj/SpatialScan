Spatial scan with Poisson Model

Used for finding spatial clusters of events over a background intensity

To run:
SpatialScanPoisson [inputFile] [windowInc] [windowCount] [#ofClusters] [#ofMonteCarlo] [HighOrLowIndicator]
[inputFile]: A CSV without header that has 4 column: x, y, numberOfCases and intensity for each location
[windowInc]: the increment of scan windows
[windowCount]: the number of scan windows put at each location, and thus the maximum scan window is [windowInc] * [windowCount]
[#ofClusters]: number of clusters to detect
[#ofMonteCarlo]: number of Monte Carlo simulation
[HighOrLowIndicator]:
	1: High value clusters only
	-1: Low value clusters only
	0: Both
